        <h2>Freshman from Greater Boston Area</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Business Administration with a double major in Ministry and Leadership.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in Bob Jones events, and I am active in my local church: Mount Calvary Baptist Church Greenville, SC. I love doing stuff with the College &amp; Career group. I sing in the choir and play my flute for small groups.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy hanging with friends as well as playing basketball.
